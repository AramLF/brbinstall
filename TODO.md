# TODO brbinstall

## Potential improvements
* The script could be executed from the main directory  
* Rearrange the whole structure (once again)
  * some blocks of code could be functions (avoid repetitions)
  * huge improvement over some awfully made functions
    * functions adding pkgs (add a new function checking if the package is already there)
* add comments & maybe better naming

## README

* A better README with imgs (to show flavor for example)

## neomint
* The middle click on cinnamon bar could be auto with json in this file : ~/.cinnamon/configs/grouped-window-list@cinnamon.org/2.json  
* Cleaning old kernel in mintupdate could be done automatically with a link (probably won't be done)
* Update the script so it could work on any de (any distro without flatpak for example, so it can add it)
