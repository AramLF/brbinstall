# TODO brbinstall

## Potential improvements
* The script could be executed from the main directory  
* Rearrange the whole structure (once again)
* add comments & maybe better naming
* some blocks of code could be functions (avoid repetitions)
* huge improvement over some awfully made functions

## README

* A better README with imgs (to show flavor for example)

## neomint
* Them middle click on cinnamon bar could be auto with json in this file : ~/.cinnamon/configs/grouped-window-list@cinnamon.org/2.json  
  * idk
* Cleaning old kernel in mintupdate could be done automatically with a link (probably won't be done)
