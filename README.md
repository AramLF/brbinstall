# brbinstall
The brbinstall purpose is to install everything I need for a fresh install of a Linux Distribution, without the hassle of doing it manually each time (it also help me familiarize myself with shell coding). It can help for : installing software, dependencies, theming, ricing, etc... This repository is in developpment, therefore it can be largely improved and is destined to changed while not following a specific Roadmap.  

## Installation
The installation and the execution is at your own risk, do it only if you know what you are doing. The scripts can be dependent of a distribution version, so it could not work in some cases.
```
git clone https://github.com/AramLF/brbinstall
```
Then change to the directory corresponding to the distribution and execute the install.sh
```
./install.sh
```

## Potential improvements
- The script could be executed from the main directory 
- Options could be added when doing ./install.sh
- User input while the installation
